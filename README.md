# ðŸ’¹ Complex Financial Instruments â€“ Simulation & Options Analytics


This branch explores the modeling and analysis of derivative products like options and futures, with a special focus on volatility behavior, pricing dynamics, and risk exposure.

Tools Used: Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib), Monte Carlo Simulation
Data Source: Historical S&P 500 Options & RBOB Gasoline pricing data

#Projects Included:

1. Options Volatility & VIX Study
A deep dive into S&P 500 options pricing behavior across strike prices and expiration dates, paired with PDF insights from VIX dynamics.

sp500_options_2010.csv â€” Options chain dataset

VIX_UPDATED.pdf â€” Theoretical reference document

Covers implied volatility surfaces, skew, and term structure.


2. RBOB Gasoline Monte Carlo Simulation
Simulates the price path of RBOB Gasoline futures using stochastic processes.

RBOB Gasoline_Simulations.ipynb â€” Complete Jupyter notebook

Includes log returns, Geometric Brownian Motion, and visualized forecast intervals.

Whether you're pricing derivatives or modeling risk under extreme events, these projects provide foundational methods to analyze and simulate complex financial instruments from first principles.
